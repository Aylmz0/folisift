# Versions

Build numbers are derived with `git rev-list --count HEAD` at compile time.
SemVer is assigned by an annotated tag; the tag is the authority, not this
table.

| Tag | Date | Build | Commit | PDFium | What changed |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| unreleased | 2026-10-26 | derived | `HEAD` | `chromium/8058` | Rust/Typst/MCP workspace; PD0–PD1 Markdown guide, 23 pages, coverage 13/13; Python engine removed |

## Notes

- The canonical guide output is `output/PD0-PD1_Calisma_Ozeti.pdf`.
- The release archive contains `folisift` and the platform PDFium shared
  library. See ADR-0005.
- Do not tag an unreleased row without running the checklist in
  `docs/agents/versioning.md`.
